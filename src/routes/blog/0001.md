## `v` units

## `vh` and `vw`

`vh` - % viewport **height**
`vw` - % viewport **width**

*caveat - in mobile views, when using `vh` content can overflow. Strongly encouraged to use media queries.

### How are they different from , for example, `width: 100%`?

`width:100%` - 100% of **parent** container

## `vmin` and `vmax`

`vmax` - looks at viewport maximum, which one is bigger. It'll take the % of the larger viewport (i.e. horizontal - width || vertical - height ).

### `vmin` and `vmax` with padding

If the height is set at `100vh`, you might to also set your padding with `vh`. This makes the padding automatically adjust based on the **height** of the screen.

### `vmin` and `vmax` with type

In general, useful for titles.

Setting font size for a title on `vw` can be super usefull for **titles**. This will make the font size increase/decrease with viewport size. For **paragraph** type thought, it's not very usefull, it can easily get funky. In general, use `em`s for **typography**.

Where `vmin` is really useful for **titles**, because it will looks at which viewport is smaller, so it will keep shrinking as the viewport gets smaller and it will get larger until one of the viewport sizes becomes smaller, so it remains proportional to a degree.

#### Pro tip

If you are using these units, you should be testing them on different viewports.
